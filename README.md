TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANALYSIS

	putonghua.pdf is the presentation slide deck.

	main.tex is the latex code generating the presentation analysis/putonghua.pdf. It takes analysis/works_cited.bib, fig/figure1-4.png, and table/table1.tex as inputs.
	
	works_cited.bib contains information about the documents I'm citing.

CODE

	putonghua.R is the code I used to do all my analysis and generate all the plots (fig/figure1-4.png) and tables (table/table1.tex). It takes data/cepsw1parentEN.dta and data/cepsw1studentEN.dta as input.
	
	There is a chunk of code in the beginning that is commented out. Use that code to install all the packages you need to run the code.

	When running the code, there may be some warning messages, and there may be moments when the code looks stuck, especially with the amelia(), check_model(), and lm() functions. The code is actually still running. Just wait a minute or two and it will continue to run.
	
DATA

	cepsw1studentEN.dta and data/cepsw1parentEN.dta are datasets to be read by code/putonghua.R. You can find the data here: http://www.cnsda.org/index.php?r=projects/view&id=72810330. Scroll down and you will find files with English names!
