	abstract = {本文以就读于八年级的流动儿童作为研究对象,考察了方言能力对其学业表现的影响及作用机制。通过对中国教育追踪调查2014—2015学年数据的分析,本研究发现,掌握流入地方言可以显著改善流动儿童的学业表现,但其影响主要体现在语文和英语两个科目上。同时,来自教师和同学的支持是方言能力影响流动儿童学业表现的作用机制。本研究从语言环境的角度揭示了流动儿童人力资本积累的逻辑,为相关部门完善与流动儿童相关的教育政策提供了经验证据。},

	abstract = {This study examines how the language used at home, Putonghua or Cantonese, has influenced the Chinese reading attainment of 4335 primary school students in Hong Kong. Also examined was the influence of the birthplace and home background socioeconomic status ({SES}) of the reader. Although the indigenous Hong Kong population uses Cantonese, a dialect of Chinese, for everyday communications, the Chinese written in school is Modern Standard Written Chinese ({MSWC}), the written equivalent of Putonghua, the spoken language of the people of China. Many of the numerous families migrating from China to Hong Kong in recent years have brought with them children educated in Putonghua in China and with extensive experience of {MSWC}. It was hypothesised that the reading attainment of these students would be superior to that of classmates born in Hong Kong and using Cantonese habitually. This would apply particularly to students from advantaged {SES} homes. The children born in China indeed had superior reading attainment. But children speaking Cantonese at home and Putonghua ‘sometimes’ had the highest reading scores, regardless of their birthplace or {SES}. The writers reflect on assumptions about the influence of the language used at home on language attainment and the implications for educational planning.},
